## Hello there, I am **TeNyain**.

A front-end developer who loves to craft and build web, a computer science student from Myanmar. I am currently specializing in front-end web development and creating web applications from my own idea.
## “ My goal is to deliver a front-end stack from scratch to well-performed websites. ”
I love to create UI designs and prototypes before implementations. Collaborations make me improve in both my technical skills and communication. I play and compose music during my spare time.
